    <h2> Timeline of his life </h2>
      
       <div id="tldate"><b>1859</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Samuel is born in London. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1873</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Becomes an apprentice clerk for various local businesses. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1878</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Gets a new job as the secretary for the London representative of Thomas Edison's telephone companies. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1881</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Emigrates to the United States and continues working for Edison, climbing the ranks inside his company.</div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1892</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Is offered the post of second vice president at General Electric, is unhappy that he wasn't named president. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1894</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Discovers the concept of the electric meter while on a Christmas visit to Brighton, England. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1897</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Introduces the meter to customers of his electricity in Chicago. Instead of paying electricity bill that depend solely on the number of lightbulbs installed, customers now pay for the energy they use. <br>This helps make electric lighting economically viable for many more customers.</div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1900-1929</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Continues building a financial empire centered on utilities. During that time, he comes up with what will be his biggest legacy: the concept of natural monopolies. Insull realizes that unlike other markets, it is inefficient to have multiple (sometimes dozens) electricity providers, with their own power plants, grids and infrastructure compete in the same markets. <br> <br> Instead, he proposes that electricity markets should be regulated, with a single company operating within limits fixed by a regulator. This way, the company benefits from the scale of serving a large number of customers, is incentivized to reduce costs of electricity, and is prevented from abusing its monopoly by the regulator, which sets a fair limit to its profits. <br> <br> Nowadays, this concept is extremely common for private operators of critical infrastructure such as providing water, highways or airports. By the 1920s, about half of the american states were regulating electricity providers in this manner.</div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1929</b></div> <div id="tltext"> His holding company collapses during the Great Depression, he loses millions and flees to France. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1934</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Is extradited back to the United States by Turkey on mail fraud and antitrust charges but is ultimately found not guilty by the jury after they deliberate for only five minutes. To avoid making their verdict look suspicious, the jurors hold a birthday party for one of them and even order cake and coffee, before finally re-entering the courtroom to announce their decision. </div>

       <div id="tldate"><b>1938</b></div> <div id="tltext"> Dies of a heart attack at the Place de la Concorde subway station in Paris. He had debts totaling $14,000,000. </div>
